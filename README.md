# Simple Blog App

The purpose of this simple blog app is to:
* Display a list of blog posts.
* Display individual blog post content on separate pages.
* Create new blog posts.
* Delete existing blog posts.

The app was developed in React, using the following libraries, methods and functionality:
* Hooks (useEffect, useState, useNavigate) and custom hooks to manage data.
* json-server to simulate an API with CRUD functionality.
* Component structure to create modular, reusable functions.
* a setTimeout to simulate data loading from an external server.
